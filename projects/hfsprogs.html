<h1>hfsprogs, the userspace hfs utils for Linux</h1>

<p><a href="https://github.com/AOSC-Dev/hfsprogs">hfsprogs</a> mainly contains mkfs and fsck for HFS and HFS+ file systems.

TODOs include adding a fork me on GitHub button.</comment></p>

<p>The HFS+ file system used by Apple Computer for their Mac OS is
supported by the Linux kernel.  Apple provides mkfs and fsck for
HFS+ with the Unix core of their operating system, Darwin.</p>

<p>This package is a port of Apple&#39;s tools for HFS+ filesystems.</p>

<p>For users, HFS+ seems to be a good compromise to carry files between
MacOS X and Linux Machines, as HFS+ doesn&#39;t suffer the problems ofFAT32 like:
  * huge space waste (in slack space as devices grow faster);
  * ability to create files that are more than 4GB in size (especially
    good for those working with multimedia and that need to carry large
    ISO files);
  * ability to use case preserving (and even sensitivity!);
  * ability to use uid&#39;s and gid&#39;s on the filesystem.</p>

<p>Users in general can enjoy such benefits since it is expected to have
more HFS+ filesystems in use, as Apple has announced Macintoshes for
x86-64, besides the filesystem being already supported by PowerPC
systems since the beginning.</p>
